## 1. Objective

To develop an AI-powered platform specifically for academic institutions that enables:

- Academic document matching and recognition for university admissions and student services.
- Student identity verification using Face ID/photo matching with educational database records.
- Intelligent academic document processing using OCR, VLM, and context-aware AI models.
- Academic credit transfer evaluation with CLO/ULO mapping and cross-institution support.

## 2. Application Scope

### A. Document Matching & Recognition

- **Use Cases**: Academic Admissions, Student Enrollment, Credit Transfers, Transcript Verification.
- **Capabilities**:
  - OCR of all kinds of documents (PDF, images).
  - Multilingual document support.
  - Dynamic format handling (e.g., mark sheets, transcripts).
  - Document comparison using context-aware AI models.

### B. Identity Verification

- Face ID/photo matching with existing database records (e.g., Hall Ticket or ID card verification).
- Performed at:
  - **Application level** (during initial upload).
  - **Entry point** (e.g., live verification on-campus).

### C. Academic Credit Transfer

- Evaluation based on:
  - **Similarity of course/unit content**.
  - **Context-based learning outcomes**.
  - CLO (Course Learning Outcomes) vs. ULO (Unit Learning Outcomes) mapping.
- Supports cross-institution articulation and student mobility.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **AI/ML Models**:
  - Vision Language Models (VLM) for document and image analysis.
  - Face recognition and identity verification models.
  - Document classification & NLP for content comparison.
  - Context-aware AI models for document matching.

- **Real-Time Capabilities**:
  - Live document scanning and OCR processing.
  - Instant identity verification at application and entry points.
  - Scalable architecture for multi-university deployment.

## 4. Development Considerations

- **Build Features**:
  - Academic document upload portal (transcripts, certificates, mark sheets).
  - AI-powered document matching engine with VLM integration for academic content.
  - Student identity verification system with Face ID/photo matching.
  - Context-aware academic document comparison and credit analysis.

- **Manual Override**:
  - Admin panel for academic staff validation and review.
  - University-specific workflows for admissions and registrar offices.
  - Continuous learning from academic expert corrections.
