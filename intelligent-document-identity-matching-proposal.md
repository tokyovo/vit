## 1. Objective

To develop an AI-powered platform that facilitates:

- Secure document and identity verification.
- Automated extraction and contextual matching of academic content for cross-institution credit transfers.
- Streamlined evaluation of student credentials using large language models (LLMs), OCR, and computer vision.

---

## 2. Application Scope

### A. Document Matching & Recognition

- **Use Cases**: Supply Chain, Logistics, Pharma, Manufacturing, Academic Admissions.
- **Capabilities**:
  - OCR of all kinds of documents (PDF, images).
  - Multilingual document support.
  - Dynamic format handling (e.g., mark sheets, transcripts).
  - Document comparison using context-aware AI models.

### B. Identity Verification

- Face ID/photo matching with existing database records (e.g., Hall Ticket or ID card verification).
- Performed at:
  - **Application level** (during initial upload).
  - **Entry point** (e.g., live verification on-campus).

### C. Academic Credit Transfer

- Evaluation based on:
  - **Similarity of course/unit content**.
  - **Context-based learning outcomes**.
  - CLO (Course Learning Outcomes) vs. ULO (Unit Learning Outcomes) mapping.
- Supports cross-institution articulation and student mobility.

---

## 3. Technology Stack

- **AI/ML Models**:
  - LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, proprietary options).
  - Image recognition models.
  - Document classification & NLP for CLO/ULO comparison.

- **Data Access & Integration**:
  - Government education data.
  - University and regulatory bodies' APIs.
  - Local databases for student records.

- **Real-Time Capabilities**:
  - Speed and scalability for live document scanning, matching, and response.

---

## 4. Development Considerations

- **Build Features**:
  - Upload portal for documents (PDF, images).
  - AI-based dynamic comparison engine.
  - Contextual NLP model training for similarity detection.

- **Manual Override**:
  - Admin panel for human validation in exceptional cases.
  - Will reduce over time with more AI/ML training.

- **Security**:
  - Compliant with data privacy and education regulations.
  - End-to-end encryption for document handling.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

- Reduced manual workload in student admission and credit evaluation processes.
- Higher accuracy in identity and document verification.
- Faster student onboarding, improved interoperability across education providers.
